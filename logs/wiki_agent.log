Since the "Category" column includes the winner's name in the format "Travis Bickle(played by Robert De Niro)", I will filter the dataframe based on the "Award" column being "Los Angeles Film Critics Association Awards" and the "Category" column containing "Best Actor". Then, I will extract the winner's name from the "Category" column.

Action: df[(df['Award'] == 'Los Angeles Film Critics Association Awards') & (df['Category'].str.

table_description: Leena Gangopadhyay is the script writer for popular Bengali serials including ' Ishti Kutum ', and ' Andarmahal '.She has also co-directed two Bengali films ' Maati ' (Earth) and ' Sanjhbati ' (Evening light).
Her serials have been remade in multiple regional Indian languages. ' Sreemoyee ' written by Gangopadhyay was made in Hindi (as Anupama), Kannada (as Inthi Nimma Asha), Marathi (as Aai Kuthe Kay Karte ), Malayalam (as Kudumbavilakku ), Telugu (as Intinti Gruhalakshmi), Tamil (as Baakiyalakshmi). Yet another serial written by Leena Gangopadhyay ' Mohor ' was remade in Kannada as 'Sarasu', Hindi as ' Shaurya Aur Anokhi Ki Kahani ', Malayalam as ‘ Koodevide ', Marathi as ‘ Swabhiman – Shodh Astitvacha ’, Tamil as ' Kaatrukkenna Veli ’ and Telugu as ' Guppedantha Manasu '.
While Leena Gangopadhyay's serials have been popular, controversy has not been far behind. She has been criticised and trolled on social media for writing stories that are regressive, called to end a few of the serials with reasons cited including lack of originality in storyline, repetitiveness in plot, the negative influence on society like the serial Guddi 7 and lack of sensitivity in portrayal of a community or people like Ishti Kutum . 8 However, Gangopadhyay, believes that we cannot call the serials progressive or regressive. In an interview with The Telegraph, she said “Writing for television is very different from writing novels. An author can be selfish but a scriptwriter will always have to keep her audience in mind. Television is after all a reflection of society. You cannot deny what exists in society. Regressive points of view exist. That is why we have them in television serials”. 9

Eastwood is one of only two people to have been twice nominated for Best Actor and Best Director for the same film ( Unforgiven and Million Dollar Baby ) the other being Warren Beatty ( Heaven Can Wait and Reds ). Along with Beatty, Robert Redford , Richard Attenborough , Kevin Costner, and Mel Gibson , he is one of the few directors best known as an actor to win an Academy Award for directing. On February 27, 2005, he became one of only three living directors (along with Miloš Forman and Francis Ford Coppola) to have directed two Best Picture winners. 396 At the age of 74, he was the oldest recipient of the Academy Award for Best Director to date.

table_description: Leena Gangopadhyay is the script writer for popular Bengali serials including ' Ishti Kutum ', and ' Andarmahal '.She has also co-directed two Bengali films ' Maati ' (Earth) and ' Sanjhbati ' (Evening light).
Her serials have been remade in multiple regional Indian languages. ' Sreemoyee ' written by Gangopadhyay was made in Hindi (as Anupama), Kannada (as Inthi Nimma Asha), Marathi (as Aai Kuthe Kay Karte ), Malayalam (as Kudumbavilakku ), Telugu (as Intinti Gruhalakshmi), Tamil (as Baakiyalakshmi). Yet another serial written by Leena Gangopadhyay ' Mohor ' was remade in Kannada as 'Sarasu', Hindi as ' Shaurya Aur Anokhi Ki Kahani ', Malayalam as ‘ Koodevide ', Marathi as ‘ Swabhiman – Shodh Astitvacha ’, Tamil as ' Kaatrukkenna Veli ’ and Telugu as ' Guppedantha Manasu '.
While Leena Gangopadhyay's serials have been popular, controversy has not been far behind. She has been criticised and trolled on social media for writing stories that are regressive, called to end a few of the serials with reasons cited including lack of originality in storyline, repetitiveness in plot, the negative influence on society like the serial Guddi 7 and lack of sensitivity in portrayal of a community or people like Ishti Kutum . 8 However, Gangopadhyay, believes that we cannot call the serials progressive or regressive. In an interview with The Telegraph, she said “Writing for television is very different from writing novels. An author can be selfish but a scriptwriter will always have to keep her audience in mind. Television is after all a reflection of society. You cannot deny what exists in society. Regressive points of view exist. That is why we have them in television serials”. 9

table_description: Leena Gangopadhyay is the script writer for popular Bengali serials including ' Ishti Kutum ', and ' Andarmahal '.She has also co-directed two Bengali films ' Maati ' (Earth) and ' Sanjhbati ' (Evening light).
Her serials have been remade in multiple regional Indian languages. ' Sreemoyee ' written by Gangopadhyay was made in Hindi (as Anupama), Kannada (as Inthi Nimma Asha), Marathi (as Aai Kuthe Kay Karte ), Malayalam (as Kudumbavilakku ), Telugu (as Intinti Gruhalakshmi), Tamil (as Baakiyalakshmi). Yet another serial written by Leena Gangopadhyay ' Mohor ' was remade in Kannada as 'Sarasu', Hindi as ' Shaurya Aur Anokhi Ki Kahani ', Malayalam as ‘ Koodevide ', Marathi as ‘ Swabhiman – Shodh Astitvacha ’, Tamil as ' Kaatrukkenna Veli ’ and Telugu as ' Guppedantha Manasu '.
While Leena Gangopadhyay's serials have been popular, controversy has not been far behind. She has been criticised and trolled on social media for writing stories that are regressive, called to end a few of the serials with reasons cited including lack of originality in storyline, repetitiveness in plot, the negative influence on society like the serial Guddi 7 and lack of sensitivity in portrayal of a community or people like Ishti Kutum . 8 However, Gangopadhyay, believes that we cannot call the serials progressive or regressive. In an interview with The Telegraph, she said “Writing for television is very different from writing novels. An author can be selfish but a scriptwriter will always have to keep her audience in mind. Television is after all a reflection of society. You cannot deny what exists in society. Regressive points of view exist. That is why we have them in television serials”. 9

table_description: Leena Gangopadhyay is the script writer for popular Bengali serials including ' Ishti Kutum ', and ' Andarmahal '.She has also co-directed two Bengali films ' Maati ' (Earth) and ' Sanjhbati ' (Evening light).
Her serials have been remade in multiple regional Indian languages. ' Sreemoyee ' written by Gangopadhyay was made in Hindi (as Anupama), Kannada (as Inthi Nimma Asha), Marathi (as Aai Kuthe Kay Karte ), Malayalam (as Kudumbavilakku ), Telugu (as Intinti Gruhalakshmi), Tamil (as Baakiyalakshmi). Yet another serial written by Leena Gangopadhyay ' Mohor ' was remade in Kannada as 'Sarasu', Hindi as ' Shaurya Aur Anokhi Ki Kahani ', Malayalam as ‘ Koodevide ', Marathi as ‘ Swabhiman – Shodh Astitvacha ’, Tamil as ' Kaatrukkenna Veli ’ and Telugu as ' Guppedantha Manasu '.
While Leena Gangopadhyay's serials have been popular, controversy has not been far behind. She has been criticised and trolled on social media for writing stories that are regressive, called to end a few of the serials with reasons cited including lack of originality in storyline, repetitiveness in plot, the negative influence on society like the serial Guddi 7 and lack of sensitivity in portrayal of a community or people like Ishti Kutum . 8 However, Gangopadhyay, believes that we cannot call the serials progressive or regressive. In an interview with The Telegraph, she said “Writing for television is very different from writing novels. An author can be selfish but a scriptwriter will always have to keep her audience in mind. Television is after all a reflection of society. You cannot deny what exists in society. Regressive points of view exist. That is why we have them in television serials”. 9

table_description: Leena Gangopadhyay is the script writer for popular Bengali serials including ' Ishti Kutum ', and ' Andarmahal '.She has also co-directed two Bengali films ' Maati ' (Earth) and ' Sanjhbati ' (Evening light).
Her serials have been remade in multiple regional Indian languages. ' Sreemoyee ' written by Gangopadhyay was made in Hindi (as Anupama), Kannada (as Inthi Nimma Asha), Marathi (as Aai Kuthe Kay Karte ), Malayalam (as Kudumbavilakku ), Telugu (as Intinti Gruhalakshmi), Tamil (as Baakiyalakshmi). Yet another serial written by Leena Gangopadhyay ' Mohor ' was remade in Kannada as 'Sarasu', Hindi as ' Shaurya Aur Anokhi Ki Kahani ', Malayalam as ‘ Koodevide ', Marathi as ‘ Swabhiman – Shodh Astitvacha ’, Tamil as ' Kaatrukkenna Veli ’ and Telugu as ' Guppedantha Manasu '.
While Leena Gangopadhyay's serials have been popular, controversy has not been far behind. She has been criticised and trolled on social media for writing stories that are regressive, called to end a few of the serials with reasons cited including lack of originality in storyline, repetitiveness in plot, the negative influence on society like the serial Guddi 7 and lack of sensitivity in portrayal of a community or people like Ishti Kutum . 8 However, Gangopadhyay, believes that we cannot call the serials progressive or regressive. In an interview with The Telegraph, she said “Writing for television is very different from writing novels. An author can be selfish but a scriptwriter will always have to keep her audience in mind. Television is after all a reflection of society. You cannot deny what exists in society. Regressive points of view exist. That is why we have them in television serials”. 9
